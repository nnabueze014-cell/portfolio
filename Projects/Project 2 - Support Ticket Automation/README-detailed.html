    <h1>Project – Support Ticket & SLA Automation System</h1>

    <p>
      This project demonstrates a real-world support and operations automation system that connects
      customer service requests to backend execution workflows with clearly defined SLAs and escalation paths.
      It mirrors how modern service-based technical companies operate at scale.

      </a>
    </div>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Many service-based technical companies still rely on informal channels such as calls and messages
      to receive customer requests. This often leads to poor tracking, missed SLAs, delayed execution,
      and lack of accountability across teams.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project addresses that gap by designing a structured, automated system that ensures
      customer requests are acknowledged, tracked, executed, and resolved with full visibility.
    </p>

    <h2>System Architecture Overview</h2>
    <p>The solution is designed using a three-layer architecture:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frontend Layer (Customer Support / Front Desk)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Automation & Integration Layer (System Bridge)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Operations & Execution Layer (Backend Unit)</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. Frontend Layer – Customer Support (Freshdesk)</h2>
    <p>
      The system begins with a customer-facing support portal built using the Freshdesk widget,
      embedded on a demo website. This serves as the official entry point for all service requests.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Customers submit service requests via the embedded widget</li>
      <li>Requests are categorized by service type and priority</li>
      <li>Preferred support method (call or email) is captured</li>
      <li>First response and resolution SLAs are automatically applied</li>
      <li>Automations monitor SLA compliance and escalate when breached</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This layer focuses on customer communication, acknowledgment, and service-level performance.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Automation & Integration Layer – System Bridge (Zapier)</h2>
    <p>
      To eliminate manual handoffs between support and operations, an automation layer was implemented
      using webhooks and Zapier.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Freshdesk sends a webhook event immediately a ticket is created</li>
      <li>Zapier listens for the event and processes the ticket data in real time</li>
      <li>A corresponding task is created in the operations tool</li>
      <li>Tasks are routed to the correct service pipeline (Electrical, Solar, CCTV, Home Automation, HVAC)</li>
      <li>Priority levels, start dates, and due dates are mapped automatically</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This ensures instant transition from customer request to operational action.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Operations & Execution Layer – Backend Unit (ClickUp)</h2>
    <p>
      The backend execution layer is managed in ClickUp, where engineers and technicians carry out the work.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Support tickets become actionable operational tasks</li>
      <li>Tasks are assigned to technicians with supervisors added as watchers</li>
      <li>A separate execution SLA governs delivery timelines</li>
      <li>SLA breaches trigger automatic status updates and alerts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This allows engineers to focus on execution while management maintains visibility and control.
    </p>

    <h2>SLA Monitoring & Escalation (End-to-End)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Front-desk SLA breaches escalate ticket priority and notify supervisors</li>
      <li>Backend SLA breaches update task status and notify relevant stakeholders</li>
      <li>Accountability is enforced from first customer contact to final resolution</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Learning Outcome</h2>
    <div class="note">
      This project represents a shift from learning individual tools to designing
      interconnected systems that reflect real operational environments.
      It demonstrates system thinking, automation logic, and service-driven design.

    <p>
      This implementation serves as a foundation for future enhancements such as advanced reporting,
      analytics, and deeper workflow automation.
